- Check: "Maybe in the future unless it's already been done...a way to keep the clouds in the sky from moving as it can reveal the frames in your animation." (by KryptojackJr) 
- Try to make quickload/quicksave (by TaBoo) 
- Expand NPC movimentation options (NPC Control) (by TaBoo) 
- Add Source Recorder stuff? "Slider to control it"? (Marcelievsky) 
- Mute the toolgun sounds (/C/ Toad) 
- Check admin mods and similar tools for ideas (like Bill Gates does) 
- Try again to hide the physgun glow when it's set to invisible 
- Make XMHText 1.1 (indexed TextEntry per line in a Dlistlayout for a decent scrollbar (then ramake the line interations (backspate, enter...) and saving function) // Decent Ctrl + z // Decent organization) (NickMBR suggested this better scrollbar idea) 
- Check FOV options for vehicles 
- If some part of a translation is missing, make it English
- Deixar o XMHText redimensionável (se não o bomberman tem que desligar o computador)
