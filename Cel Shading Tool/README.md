Features:
- 3 rendering modes: Sobel Post Processing, Garry's Mod 12 Like Halos, Garry's Mod 13 Halos;
- Customization options: set sizes, make it shake, set colors;
- Duplicator support; 
- Ragdoll/NPC support; 
- Partial "CTRL + Z" support; 
- Copy/Reload support; 
- Multiplayer support. 

Known problems:
- The rendering modes don't always work;
- GM 12 mode keeps rendering entities when players are out of the map / inside wall;
- Because of the problem right above, entities in GM 12 mode become visible in the 3D Skybox;
- It's not possible to apply colors to Sobel mode;
- GM 13 mode seems to be more heavy than it should be;
- The duplicator still needs to be cleaned when the player removes cel shading properties from a entity.
